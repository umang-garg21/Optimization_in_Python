    "### Prob 1: Graph Partition\n",
    "\n",
    "Graph bi-partition is a fairly simple problem to setup using Docplex. However, we need to use it recursively and in concert with the linear partition code from HW2. So, In this problem you need to first modify the code form HW2 to create a class and some methods. The class should be named 'Place1' with a method to build a random Uniform netlist on N blocks called 'mk_uni_net(N)' which creates the \\<self\\>.net dictionary and \\<self\\>.M = # of nets and \\<self\\>.N = # of boxes to place.\n",
    "\n",
    "Make a graph partition method gpart() that forms a bi-partition of <self>.net with partition sizes: $P1 = N//2$ and $P2 = N-(N//2)$\n",
    "    \n",
    "i.e. $P1 <= P2$ and $P1+P2 == N$.\n",

For i larger than 0, Find the global optimal partition (smallest sum of partition crossing edges) where the partition sizes can vary as follows: $P1 = N//2-i,N//2-i+1,..,N//2+i-1,N//2+i$ and $P2 = N - P1$. This allows the partition algorithm to find better partitions over a range of sizes, but still with reasonable weights.\n",

Then run some larger  random partition cases, where you re-run with larger values of i, measuring the run time. It should always be the case that wider allowed partitions find equivalent or lower cost cuts. What happens to the run time as i is increased?\n",

    "### Prob 3: Placement by Recursive Bi-partition\n",
    "Here, we re-visit the problem of linear placement, for larger examples of uniform sized boxes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The general strategy is to efficiently partition the graph into small sub-problems connected by minimal cuts to a size that can be efficiently solved by the exact solver you already have. (You get to tune the size and flexibility of the partitions and the size to use the exact partition). Then you assemble the netlist, with positions from the previous scale solutions. Note that you can invoke your exact partitioner to make increment improvements fixed or warm restarts.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a fixed restart, you set additional constraints based on your previous solved problems and run the solver with those  constraints. (e.g. you could have the solver re-order the elements within position boundaries set by the partitions).\n",
    "\n",
    "In a warm restart you use the following sequence:\n",
    "```\n",
    "    warmstart=mdl.new_solution()\n",
    "    warmstart.add_var_value(values...)\n",
    "    warmstart.add_var_value(more values...)\n",
    "    mdl.add_mip_start(warmstart)\n",
    "    mdl.solve()\n",
    "```\n",
    "then solve as usual. The trial solution need not be a feasible one. The fixed-start case runs a substantially reduced problem while the warm start just starts from the solution points you recommend. In neither case is your exact algorithm likely to find optimality unless you are very restrictive in the fixed start, so it makes sense to run for a limited period of time to make use of cplex incremental improvements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using your placer, run linear placements for 10 and 15 elements checking against your optimal answers. For 50, 100, 150, 200, ... compare your results with those from early integer results of the exact algorithm when found in less than 200 sec. Plot the runtime trend of your heuristic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since you have multiple options here, please don't go crazy with tuning once you have a working algorithm as you can spend enormous time doing so.\n",
    "\n",
    "For verification, run the weighted sample above as a linear placement. (Plot the result for this case)."
